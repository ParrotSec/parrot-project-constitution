WORK IN PROGRESS


This is a draft of the constitution of the Parrot Project v 0.2

This constitution is NOT valid until the release of its first stable version (v1.0), but it can be used as an unofficial set of rules to follow.



===== Introduction =====

The Parrot Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create and maintain a free operating system and to make activities aimed at raising awareness on software freedom, security and privacy.

This document describes the organisational structure of the project.





===== The association =====

As a free association of individuals, the Parrot Project defines itself as a free association of people working as volunteers on the development of the Parrot operating system (also known as ParrotSec, Parrot OS, Parrot Security, Parrot Linux or just Parrot), or in other activities developed by the projet.

The project is actually not a legally recognized organization, all the legal responsibilities related to it are personally charged to the Team Leader and Founder of the project (Lorenzo Giusto Faletra). This would be changed in the future as the Parrot Project is meant to become a non-profit organization as soon as possible.

The project is NOT lucrative.





===== Roles in the project =====

The Parrot Project recognizes some official figures in its community to make the development and decision-making processes easier and faster, the roles inside the Parrot Project are solely intended to distribute responsibilities, and not to give more power to people covering higher roles.

The Parrot Project defines the following roles further described in the following paragraphs (in order of importance):

  * Team Leader, Project Leader or Founder
  * Core Developer
  * Ambassador
  * Developer
  * Contributor







===== General rules =====

Nothing in this constitution imposes an obligation on anyone to work for the Project and every member is free to work on it according to their free will.

People who do not want to do a task which has been delegated or assigned to them are not forced to do it in any way.
However, they must not actively work against these rules and decisions.

A person may leave the Project or resign from a particular role they hold, at any time, by stating so publicly.





==== Team Leader ====

The role of the Team Leader (also Project Leader or Founder) is assigned to the founder of the project, which has also the responsibility to give the ok to important community proposals or take important decisions for the future of the project.

The Team Leader have also the responsibility to keep the development process coherent with the purposes of the project, to officially represent the whole Parrot Project and to act as a benevolent dictator in all those cases where the decisions taken by the other developers could clearly damage or destabilize the project.

Even if this role is indefinitely taken by the founder, this may change if the founder decides to leave the project; in this case an election-based system needs to be discussed by the Core Developers and implemented inside the constitution, in order to choose the new Team Leader, while the project creator can still keep the title of "Founder" for historical reasons inside the project.


The Team leader is also member of the Core Developers and it is subject to the same responsabilities of the other Core Developers.

The Founder is Lorenzo Giusto Faletra, aka Palinuro: palinuro@parrotsec.org - GPG: B350 5059 3C2F 7656 40E6  DDDB 97CA A129 F4C6 B9A4

As of now, the Founder is also the current Team Leader of the project.



==== Core Developers ====

A Core Developer is a person who actively contribute to the project and has also the responsibility to maintain, coordinate or represent fundamental parts of the project.

Core Developers are always involved in the decision-making process of the project and are composed by those people who have demonstrated to be particularly devoted to the project development, particularly close to the project goals and particularly reliable and trustworthy.

The role of the Core Developer can be assigned in two ways: directly by the Team Leader, or by another Core Developer after the approvation of the other Core developers and the Team Leader.

An active contributor became a Core Developer when an official message appears in an official project channel. The message is valid ONLY if it was signed by the GPG key of the Team Leader.

A Core Developer is obliged to keep her private GPG key under the highest security standards and have to prove that to the other Core Developers.



==== Developers ====

The role of Developer is given to those members of the community whose contributions to the development of the system was effective, reliable and constant over time.

The role can be assigned by a Core Developer, which have to evaluate the work of the applicant subject and notify the community and the other Core Developers of this choice.

A Contributor is confirmed in the role of Developer when a public message GPG-signed by a Core Developer appears.

Other Developers can propose to a Core Developer to evaluate the work of a contributor.




==== Contributors ====

A Contributor is a community member who did something useful for the project like one of the following things:

  * Code Contribution.
  * Bugfixes, bug reports or testing activities.
  * Contribution to the documentation of the project.
  * Evident contribution in handling the Parrot Community.

A Core Developer have to watch to the contributions received to the project and recognize the author as a Parrot Contributor if the contribution does not damage the Parrot Project or the specific component where the contribution was given.




==== Ambassadors ====

Parrot Ambassadors are a global group of volunteers who have distinguished themselves in the Parrot international or local communities for their skills and attitude to encourage others to contribute to the Parrot Project and utilize FLOSS ([[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.html]]) products for Cyber Security and internet freedom defense.

The procedure to apply as a Parrot Ambassador is described in the Community Portal.

The role is assigned in two ways: by a Core Developer, or by other Parrot Ambassadors if they are delegated by a Core Developer to assign the role to that particular applicant.

The Parrot Ambassadors are coordinated through the dedicated mailing list or through the dedicated forum board in the community portal.

The Parrot Ambassadors are meant to organize events, help the community and represent the project in special situations.

A Parrot Ambassador can represent the Parrot Project in a public event after the GPG-signed and public approval of a Core Developer, which is valid for the sigle event and which can be revoked if the way the project was represented is not compliant to to the project goals or if it damages the project.
